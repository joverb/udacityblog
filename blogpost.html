            <p>This is an example of a blog post where I am writing about the various reasons that I should be cheerful at this time. I recently became a mum in February and am enjoying spending time with my three month old Jamie Lou, and my partner Tom.</p>

            <p> I have been studying front end web-development in Tom's garden music studio, which has been a lot of fun so far. I am on project one which is teaching me everything that can be done with HTML and CSS coding, using grids and flexboxes. I am finding coding requires quite a bit of patience and concentration to get things right, but is very rewarding.</p>
            <p> I hope to continue my studies into front-end coding and with practice my code will get cleaner and more precise. It is very much a problem solving process and my skills are bound to improve when I put the hours in.</p>
            <p> Now the weather is improving and I feel really lucky to be at home with my family, despite all the events going on in the world at the moment. I hope to use the time to really learn some great skills so that I can maybe apply them to some interesting work in the coming years. </p>
            <p> I'm looking forward to the next project where I will be learning about Javascript.</p>
